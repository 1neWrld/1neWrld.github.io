    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Wandipa Marema, and this blog — My Lines of Progress — is my digital journal.
      It's where I track and display my growth in programming, personal hobbies, problem-solving, and life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through major setbacks I've decided to become one who learns by documenting. Writing posts, breaking down concepts,
      and sharing insights helps me understand things better. This blog exists, so I
      can look back and see how far I've come, and for you to see who you're getting to know.
    </p>

    <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Coding and programming concepts</li>
      <li>My journey learning programming languages and frameworks</li>
      <li>Sketches, drawings, and art practice</li>
      <li>Random thoughts, insights, and life lessons</li>
      <li>Any progress I make — big or small</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why “Line of Progress”?</h2>
    <p>
      The goal is simple: express things in a clean, direct, and honest way.
      No noise. No overcomplication. Just clarity — whether it’s code, art, or thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something here that inspires you,
      helps you learn, or just makes you think.
