My third reflection... This week has been a bit challenging surprisingly. After the week long learning recession, to recuperate and revise. I jumped back into learning new topics, Cryptography. In short,
this is the tool used to ensure passwords are secure, transmitted data are held with integrity, and one to one communication is made confidential. 

I was slightly worried about the math, as a person who is... Mediocre at the subject I was dubious on whether I would understand the math invoked within ciphers, but it my understanding was smooth sailing. Well
it wasn't hard at all to figure out. Despite this, knowing how passwords are securely stored gives me a sense of reassurance. There's a slight joy when discovering the complex technicality within an abstraction.

I briefly railed off topic, the challenge of this week, was the difficulty in actually getting back on my routine. Switching my mind back into the grind after a week off, was surprisingly hard! I found myself losing
focus, and procrastinating a decent amount. Maybe, this is the moment in time where my discipline prevails. As discipline is a muscle after all. 

I'll probably start posting more. I believe my posts have been drifting away from the topics and tools I've learnt. After all I want to use these post to show what I've learnt technically not emotionally XD!! Well, I've
been going through John the Ripper a hash cracking tool and My next post will be discussing that and deeper thoughts on what I've learnt within Cryptography.
