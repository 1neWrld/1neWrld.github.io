I fell off my routine!

On January 5th 2025, I made a goal to limit social media usage for a whole month. I chose this to replace bad habits with good ones. Since I'm not completely stopping my social media usage but taking a break from it, a reset, a month doesn't sound too bad. 

I had an idealised idea of the person I would come out as, at the conclusion of my challenge. I believed it went well. The first week was a challenge, though after that, it was a pleasant experience. I read more, my drawing practice and cybersecurity learning was consistent. I had a solid routine that was healthy, and productive.
 
Though on February 6th I downloaded TikTok again, and all the old habits withered back, worse than before! This detox if you would, was good for me, but going back to one of the habits that had a negatively potent influence on my productivity was a bad move. My abstinence from the app made it worse when I came back. To a point where I spent multiple days just watching TikToks, and when you have one rat in the house, you quickly end up with a dozen more. All the other bad habits came back. 

As you see the heading. This is a week reflection for 2 weeks, as I couldn't get myself to do 'WR9', due to my time being spent doing unproductive things. I barely touched my pencils to draw, when learning CyberSec, I did the bare minimum, logging off after one task. My mind feels foggy, the clear mind I gained got even foggier, and surprisingly I still stayed consistent with my reading, but I'm not satisfied with that.
 
I know the reason why, I know what I have to do, but I cannot get myself to do it. I ask myself would it be better to completely change, or try to steadily integrate the good with the bad, then through time completely replace. Though why!?

Why do I have to do that? One of my previous posts, I spoke on how, sometimes in order for something new to come, something old has to go. I've spent a month without it. I discovered the consistent, disciplined person I can be. The mentality is there!! A change of mindset is needed! I have to grow my tolerance for uncertainty. 

Tomorrow I will delete — I've just deleted all social media. I have to make that change. It will suck, but I know I can make that change, as I've already done it for a month! That erroneous idea in my head was influencing this last paragraph. I was not ready to feel such discomfort, so I wanted to stall it till the next day, but action is needed now! So I'll wake up tomorrow! I'll draw, read, workout, and most importantly, learn CyberSecurity, and I'll track all my progress here!!
