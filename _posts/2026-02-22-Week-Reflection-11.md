After a week of inconsistency, my consistency is steadily coming back. I've learnt a couple of topics in regards to web hacking.

File Inclusion, which I've already graced with its own blog post — One of the hardest topics so far, a vulnerability giving me the ability to access data not disclosed to the public, due to bad URL filtering, and sanitization. Cross-Site scripting, an exploit meant to run on a target browser, when executed gives me control of their accounts/sessions. Server-Side request forgery — I 'forge' an HTTP request to the resource of my choosing which the webserver adheres to. I'll definitely go more in depth on these topics in the next Introduction to Web-Hacking blog post. And if I may add — Did a ton of drawing too!!

In my previous week reflection, I made the mistake of wanting to delay eradicating insidious habits affecting my progress. Despite the short dilemma, I made the right choice. I deleted all the unnecessary apps affecting me from reaching necessary goals. TikTok was the main source of my inconsistencies during that period. The pernicious app had me zombified for hours, not getting anything productive done.

Though that was all discussed in the previous reflection — Back to my consistent regimen, learning web-hacking basics. I've known for a while now that this career path requires constant iteration, keeping up and refreshing on the basics. That's why I've decided to put my entire focus next week on revising the previous work learnt in the 101 module.

To refresh myself on the concepts of HTTP Requests, Response, Cryptography, other protocols and topics utilised within the web, is essential to fully grasp the foundation of web hacking.

My drawing has been consistent too! As this hobby is another example of an iterative task, requiring constant practice. I've swiftly incorporated drawing as a new way to ease my boredom. Though it's not as instantly rewarding as TikTok. I can say, the feeling of drawing what I intended after hours of frustration feels very good!

So I'll keep going at it. Learning and improving as I go on. Tomorrow I'll revise my networking knowledge and report back here.
