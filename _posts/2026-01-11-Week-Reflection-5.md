5 Weeks in, and I'm starting to reflect(no pun intended) on the progress made, and the problems faced. I entered this space knowing minimal, to now knowing the essence of the internet, cryptography, and web hacking.
This reflection will be short but I want to talk about the importance of living in the now. Specifically in terms of situations I'm unable to solve at this current moment.

I came across a reddit post, a person my age pleading for help as they were struggling finding work, whilst student loans simultaneously creeping in. This is a very common situation people my age are currently
experiencing. We live in a time where a smooth transition from school to work life is fraught with trepidation, but a redditor commented providing their perspective. "Don't worry about things you're currently unable
to solve".

I'm 100% certain the situation she's in is profoundly stressful, but carrying such a negative burden over something that's not under ones control, or currently unfixable isn't right. This is something I should
incorporate into my life. My constant consistency met with disappointment, frustration when faced with setbacks I'm unable to solve, slows me down way more than just accepting my current situations and letting things
take its course.

From struggling with Metasploit to feeling severe burnout. From allowing myself to fail to being bad at topics. These are apart of the journey!
