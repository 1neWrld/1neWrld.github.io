My second reflection in the series. This long week break has been rejuvenating, and informative. My last post, I was vocal on the importance of active recall in my cyber security journey. Its an approach that allows me to
test my understading rather than just cramming the knowledge read. These last seven days, was strictly for light revision and rest, and now I'm ready to tackle new topics this coming week!  

Though I want to talk about the importance of allowing myself to be bad, to fail. I came across a video where an artist spoke about how people refuse to let themselves be bad or fail at something. This past year I've been very hard on myself. 
I struggle to accept that learning new skills, takes time with a ton of trial and error. The need of wanting the end product now, lack of patience is a tendency that strips me of happiness. 
Drawings a perfect example. Drawing is a skill that takes a ton of time and effort to master, with a profound amount of setbacks. Some don't have the willingness to persevere through the obstacles, 
as most want the skill of their favourite artists, (Kim jung Gi for one) without the years of grinding and learning. 

This is something that applies to most of my ventures, new skills I want to acquire. Most of the things that contain real value take time to master, and not appreciating the process from bad to good, good to exceptional, is the issue.  
For me of course XD! If I truly grasp this beautiful bit of wisdom, the time I take, the setbacks I experience, rather it being major roadblocks in my development, one could see it as just a new path for an even greater outcome in 
ones journey.
