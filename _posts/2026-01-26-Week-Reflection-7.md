7th week reflection! 

Today, I read through my last 6 weekly reflections, and at a time where I felt my progress was declining, I wasn't making any improvements in my cybersecurity learning. Reading through my past thoughts has opened my eyes to how each week, I elaborated my thoughts, utilising all the setbacks and successes from the previous weeks. 

Each week reflection, was written by an improved version of myself, that struggled, overcame, and learnt. Week reflection 2 (I think), I spoke about the fatigue that infested me, and for sometime viewed this as a sign of weakness, lack of discipline, not motivated enough. Something I didn't understand at the time, was how burnout is a thing that happens to everyone, and when a day came when I opened TryHackMe and every word read, felt elongated and slurred. I decided to take a week off. 

What firstly felt like a disappointment, turned into a strategic masterplan. With the use of 'Active Recall' I revised the content learnt. What was supposed to be a one week break, turned into a two week break, consisting of light revision and prioritising other hobbies (Drawing). 

This type of struggle, reflection, and improvisation is what builds my character. Week Reflection 6, I discussed succumbing to old habits. Reflecting on my struggles enables me to identify what caused my downward spiral and how to improve from previous mistakes. What worked for me and what didn't.

Times I feel stagnant, Where I won't want to continue. I'll read through my old reflections, to see how far I've come, the challenges persevered, the goals triumphed, and the person built overtime. That will be the fuel to keep going.

Week 8 is right here, and I'm ready to learn, struggle, and persevere!
