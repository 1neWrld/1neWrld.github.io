My recent post I was very vocal on how this consistent grind has burnt me out, which incentivised me to take a few days off, clearing my mind and reassessing the content I've absorbed. I thought that this break would be
a short weekend refresher, though now I've decided to take the entire week off learing new content XD! The firt 2 days I did nothing in terms of cyber security, turned my mind to prioritising my hobbies, and things.
Though now I've been gradually been revising the content learnt. So now I decided to make this week a time of rest but Active Recall too.

This is a process that that I've actually been actively... No pun intended. Actively notcing progress to the information I'm retaining. Not just regurgitating definitions I've read, but being able to explain these topics in
my own words. Your probably wondering how I approach this process. So lemme spill the beans... CHATGPT XD!!  I tell the AI what I've learnt, and to give me questions ranging in difficulty to test my understanding. The beginner
question are normal your High school cycle test questions, like What is a DHCP blah blah blah. The real graft comes in the Advanced section where you have to utilise your entry level understanding of a certain protocol or networking
concept and use your logical thinking to decipher the queston for example, "If ping works but traceroute fails, what might that indicate about the network?"

These questions help me fully grasp basic level concepts, by utilising the principles, to thoroughly reason my way through a advanced question. The ones I get wrong, and these are not just advanced questions, beginner and intermediate ones
too. That is just an indicator of what I need to brush up on, and it STICKS!! 

Active Recall is my main source when testing my understanding of certain topics, and this is also where AI comes in clutch!
