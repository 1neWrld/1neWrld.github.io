I've just completed the Pre Security Path on TryHackMe... Awesome! I enjoyed every bit of it. Interesting, and instructive, though some parts bored me, and a few of the questions in the modules were pretty confusing, enjoyable. 

This beginner path contained fundamental theory every cybersecurity enthusiast should know. It started of with having me recollect my learning from the high school subject, CAT, with Networking basics, DNS, TCP, Ports, switches, IP addresses, packets and volumes, and a myriad of other concepts that started to pop up in my memory. My favourite section was learning the basics of the Linux operating system. The majority of it was easy to digest, as I have a entry level understanding of the OS due to using WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux), on VSCode when coding. They educated me on commonly used, and useful prompts such as cd, touch, mkdir etc. Which I already knew about, but after the tedious walkthrough of the basics, it gets extremely complex. Traversing into processes, which are programs that run on the system. They guide us on ways to view processes, start, stop, and manipulate them on the system. Running commands in the background, whilst simultaneously doing other tasks, had me feeling like a hacking guru. Briefly touching on terminal editors such as nano, and VIM, the latter being a much more complex version, still very good and  informative.

Though still a ton of stuff to learn and do. I'm excited to see where this journey will take me. I've just begun the "Cyber Security 101" module, which will gradually ease me into the base level of cyber security. I will continue to document my progress.
